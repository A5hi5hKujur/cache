# Cache Design
Simple implementation of in-memory REST cache. Cache is designed to support these operations :

* **PUT**   : This allows users to put a value against a key in the cache.
* **GET**   : This allows users to get a value against a key from the cache.

## Expectations
* Follow clean code and try to implement as many Low Level System Design patterns as much is possible or relevant. </br></br>
* Data should be fetched from in memory in the GET operation. </br></br>
* Data should have an option to be persistent.

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository. </br></br>
